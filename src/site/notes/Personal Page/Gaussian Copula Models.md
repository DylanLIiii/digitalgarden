A Gaussian copula is a type of copula that is defined by a multivariate distribution with a Gaussian copula density function. In a Gaussian copula model, the joint distribution of multiple variables is defined by the copula function, which describes the dependence structure between the variables, and the marginal distribution of each variable, which describes the distribution of each variable individually.

The copula function can be expressed as:

$$C(u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n) = \Phi_n(\Phi^{-1}(u_1), \Phi^{-1}(u_2), \dots, \Phi^{-1}(u_n))$$

where $\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution and $\Phi_n$ is the CDF of the $n$-dimensional standard normal distribution. $u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n$ are the marginal uniform distributions for the variables $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$, respectively.

The joint probability density function (PDF) for the Gaussian copula model can be expressed as:

$$f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) = c(\Phi(x_1), \Phi(x_2), \dots, \Phi(x_n))\prod_{i=1}^n \phi(x_i)$$

where $\phi$ is the PDF of the standard normal distribution.

The Gaussian copula is widely used in finance, particularly in the pricing of financial derivatives. It is often used to model the dependence structure between multiple risk factors in a portfolio, such as the prices of different assets or the values of different financial instruments. The Gaussian copula is attractive in these applications because it allows for flexible modeling of the dependence structure between variables and because it is relatively easy to work with mathematically.

However, the Gaussian copula has been criticized in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, as it was found to underestimate the risk of extreme events in some cases. As a result, alternative copula models have been proposed that may be more suitable for modeling extreme events.
