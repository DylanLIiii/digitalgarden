Vasicek's model is a mathematical model for the evolution of the interest rate over time. It is a one-factor model, meaning that it only considers a single risk factor (in this case, the interest rate) in its calculations. Vasicek's model is often used to price fixed income securities, such as bonds, and to calculate the value of interest rate derivatives.

The model is based on the following assumptions:

-   The interest rate follows a mean-reverting process, meaning that it tends to move back towards a long-term average value over time.
-   The interest rate is subject to Brownian motion, meaning that it exhibits random fluctuations that are governed by the normal distribution.

The Vasicek model can be expressed as a stochastic differential equation:

$$dr(t) = (\theta - ar(t))dt + \sigma dW(t)$$

where $r(t)$ is the interest rate at time $t$, $\theta$ is the long-term mean of the interest rate, $a$ is the speed at which the interest rate reverts to its mean, $\sigma$ is the volatility of the interest rate, and $W(t)$ is a standard Brownian motion process.

The Vasicek model can be solved analytically to give the following closed-form solution for the interest rate at time $t$:

$$r(t) = \theta + (r(0) - \theta)e^{-at} + \sigma \int_0^t e^{-a(t-s)}dW(s)$$

where $r(0)$ is the initial value of the interest rate.

The Vasicek model has several useful properties, including the fact that it can be used to accurately model the term structure of interest rates (i.e., the relationship between the interest rate and the length of time for which it is borrowed). However, it is a relatively simple model and may not be sufficient to capture the complexity of real-world interest rate dynamics in all cases. As a result, more sophisticated models, such as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model, have been developed to more accurately model the evolution of the interest rate over time.
