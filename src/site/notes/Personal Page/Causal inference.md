Causal inference refers to the process of determining the cause-and-effect relationship between two variables. In other words, it is the process of determining whether a change in one variable (the cause) leads to a change in another variable (the effect).

Mathematically, we can represent the cause-and-effect relationship between two variables X and Y using the following notation:

$Y = f(X) + \epsilon$

Where:

-   Y is the dependent variable (the effect)
-   X is the independent variable (the cause)
-   f(X) represents the functional relationship between X and Y
-   $\epsilon$ is the error term, which represents the influence of all other factors that may affect Y but are not captured by X.

The goal of causal inference is to estimate the functional relationship f(X) as accurately as possible. This can be done using statistical methods such as regression analysis, which involves fitting a mathematical model to the data to estimate the relationship between X and Y.

It is important to note that causal inference can be challenging because it is often difficult to control for all the other factors that may influence Y. For example, if we are studying the relationship between education level (X) and income (Y), there may be other factors such as job experience and occupation that also influence income. To accurately estimate the causal effect of education on income, we would need to control for these other factors as much as possible.
