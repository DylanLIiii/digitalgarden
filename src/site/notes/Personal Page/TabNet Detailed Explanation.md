## Introduction
At a high level, TabNet is a neural network that takes in a matrix of input features and produces a prediction or classification as output. Specifically, it consists of multiple layers of attention-based processing units, which are designed to weight the input features and model their interactions.

The attention mechanism used in TabNet is based on the self-attention mechanism, which was originally introduced in the [[Personal Page/transformer\|transformer]] model for natural language processing. In self-attention, the output at each position in a sequence is calculated as a weighted sum of the input features at all positions, where the weights are learned through the attention mechanism.

In TabNet, this attention mechanism is applied to the input features in a tabular dataset, rather than a sequence of words. Specifically, the attention mechanism is used to weight the input features at each position (i.e., each column in the input matrix) based on their importance for a given task. These weights are learned through training and allow the model to automatically identify which features are most important for a given prediction.

## Attention mechanism

The attention mechanism in TabNet is based on the self-attention mechanism, which calculates the output at each position in a sequence as a weighted sum of the input features at all positions. This can be written mathematically as follows:

$$\textbf{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \textbf{w}_i \cdot \textbf{x}_i$$

where $\textbf{y}$ is the output at a given position, $\textbf{x}_i$ is the input feature at position $i$, and $\textbf{w}_i$ is the weight assigned to the input feature at position $i$. These weights are learned through the attention mechanism and allow the model to selectively weight the input features based on their importance for a given task.

In TabNet, the attention mechanism is applied to the input features in a tabular dataset, rather than a sequence of words. Specifically, the attention weights are calculated using the following equation:

$$\textbf{w}_i = \frac{\exp(\textbf{q}^T \textbf{k}_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(\textbf{q}^T \textbf{k}_j)}$$

where $\textbf{q}$ is a query vector that is learned through training, and $\textbf{k}_i$ is a key vector for the input feature at position $i$. The dot product between the query and key vectors is used to measure the similarity between the two, and the exponential function is used to weight the input features based on this similarity.
